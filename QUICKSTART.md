   - See [Troubleshooting - Build Failed](#problem-build-failed-in-platformio)
   - You'll need to fix the error before continuing

### Step 3: Upload to Teensy

"Uploading" means sending the program from your computer to the Teensy.

**FIRST: Connect the Teensy**

1. **Find** your Teensy 4.1 device (the small circuit board)
2. **Find** a micro-USB cable
   - This is a small USB cable (smaller than a phone charger)
   - One end is micro-USB (small rectangular), other end is regular USB
3. **Plug the micro-USB end** into the Teensy
   - There's a micro-USB port on the Teensy board
4. **Plug the other end** into your computer's USB port
5. **WAIT** 5-10 seconds for Windows to recognize the device
   - You might hear a "ding" sound from Windows
   - You might see a notification in the bottom-right

**NOW: Upload the Program**

6. **Look at the bottom** of Visual Studio Code again
7. **Find the RIGHT ARROW icon** (→)
   - It's next to the checkmark you clicked before
   - Move your mouse over it - tooltip says "PlatformIO: Upload"
8. **Click once** on the **right arrow** icon (→)
9. **WATCH the terminal** at the bottom
   - You'll see text scrolling
   - It might rebuild the code first (that's normal)
   - You'll see "Uploading..."
10. **A NEW WINDOW might appear** called "Teensy"
    - This is the Teensy Loader program
    - This is NORMAL - don't close it
    - It shows a progress bar
11. **WATCH for the upload to complete**:
    - The Teensy window (if it appeared) will show "Reboot OK"
    - The Teensy will automatically restart
    - The terminal in VS Code will show `[SUCCESS]` in **GREEN**
12. **If you see `[SUCCESS]`**:
    - **EXCELLENT!** The firmware is now on the Teensy!
    - The Teensy has restarted and is running your program
    - You can close the Teensy Loader window if it appeared (click the X)
13. **If you see `[FAILED]`**:
    - See [Troubleshooting - Upload Failed](#problem-upload-failed--teensy-not-found)
    - Make sure the Teensy is plugged in
    - Try pressing the white button on the Teensy, then click Upload again

---

## Connecting to the Device

### Step 1: Find the COM Port

The "COM port" is how Windows identifies the Teensy. We need to find out what number it is.

1. **Make sure the Teensy is plugged into your computer** via micro-USB
   - If not, plug it in now
   - Wait 10 seconds after plugging it in
2. **Press and hold** the **Windows key** (⊞)
3. **While holding it**, press the letter **X** key
4. **Release both keys**
5. **A menu appears** in the bottom-left corner of your screen
   - This is the "Quick Link menu"
6. **Look through the menu** for an item that says **"Device Manager"**
   - It's usually about halfway down the list
7. **Click once** on **"Device Manager"**
8. **A new window opens** called "Device Manager"
   - This window shows all the hardware connected to your computer
9. **Look for** an item in the list called **"Ports (COM & LPT)"**
   - You may need to scroll down to find it
   - It has a little arrow or triangle next to it
10. **Click once** on the arrow/triangle next to "Ports (COM & LPT)"
    - The list expands to show devices underneath
11. **Look for** an entry that says one of these:
    - "USB Serial Device (COM3)"
    - "Teensy USB Serial (COM4)"
    - "Serial Port (COM5)"
    - The number might be different - could be COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, etc.
12. **WRITE DOWN** the COM number
    - Example: If it says "USB Serial Device (COM4)", write down: **COM4**
    - You'll need this number in the next steps
13. **Close** the Device Manager window (click the X in the top-right)

**Can't find any COM ports?**
- **Unplug** the Teensy from your computer
- **Wait** 5 seconds
- **Plug it back in**
- **Wait** 10 seconds
- Try the steps above again
- Still nothing? See [Troubleshooting - No COM Port](#problem-no-com-port-shows-up-in-device-manager)

### Step 2: Open PowerShell in the Right Folder

PowerShell is a program where you type commands. We need to open it in the AvaSpecDriver folder.

**Method 1 - EASIEST Way (Using File Explorer):**

1. **Find** the folder icon on your taskbar (bottom of screen)
   - It looks like a yellow folder
   - It might say "File Explorer" when you hover over it
2. **Click once** on the folder icon
3. **File Explorer opens** - this shows your files and folders
4. **Navigate to where you saved the repository**:

   **If you saved it in Documents:**
   - **Click** "Documents" in the left sidebar
   - **Double-click** the folder named "aeris-via-software"
   - **Double-click** the folder named "AvaSpecDriver"

   **If you saved it on Desktop:**
   - **Click** "Desktop" in the left sidebar
   - **Double-click** the folder named "aeris-via-software"
   - **Double-click** the folder named "AvaSpecDriver"

5. **You should now see** files like:
   - VIA.bat
   - platformio.ini
   - Several folders (src, lib, include, etc.)
6. **Look at the very top** of the File Explorer window
   - There's an address bar showing the folder path
   - It says something like: `This PC > Documents > aeris-via-software > AvaSpecDriver`
7. **Click once INSIDE the address bar** (on the text itself)
   - The text becomes highlighted in blue
   - You can now type in this bar
8. **Type exactly**: `powershell`
9. **Press Enter**
10. **A BLUE WINDOW appears** - this is PowerShell!
    - It says "Windows PowerShell" at the top
    - You'll see text ending with something like `PS C:\...\AvaSpecDriver>`
    - This is the PowerShell prompt
11. **SUCCESS!** PowerShell is open in the correct folder

### Step 3: Run the VIA Console

VIA.bat is a program that connects to the Teensy and lets you control it.

1. **Make sure the blue PowerShell window is still open**
   - If you closed it, go back to Step 2
2. **Look at the PowerShell window**
   - There should be a prompt that ends with `>`
   - The cursor is blinking, waiting for you to type
3. **Remember the COM port number** you wrote down in Step 1
   - Was it COM3? COM4? COM5?

**If your COM port is COM3:**

4. **Type exactly**: `.\VIA.bat`
   - Don't forget the period and backslash at the start!
5. **Press Enter**
6. **Go to step 7 below**

**If your COM port is NOT COM3 (it's COM4, COM5, etc.):**

4. **Type exactly**: `.\VIA.bat COM4`
   - Replace `COM4` with YOUR actual COM port number
   - Example: If yours is COM5, type: `.\VIA.bat COM5`
   - Make sure there's a SPACE between VIA.bat and the COM number
5. **Press Enter**
6. **Continue to step 7 below**

**NOW WATCH WHAT HAPPENS:**

7. **The PowerShell window fills with text**
   - You'll see a welcome message
   - You'll see information about connecting
   - This takes 2-5 seconds
8. **LOOK FOR** a prompt that says: `VIA>`
   - When you see this, the program is ready!
   - The cursor will be blinking after `VIA>`
9. **SUCCESS!** You're connected to the Teensy!

**What if it doesn't work?**
- See [Troubleshooting - VIA.bat closes immediately](#problem-viabat-opens-and-immediately-closes)
- Or see [Troubleshooting - Python not found](#problem-python-is-not-recognized-as-a-command)

### Step 4: Test the Connection

Let's make sure everything is working by asking for help.

1. **Look at the PowerShell window** with the `VIA>` prompt
2. **Click anywhere in the PowerShell window** to make sure it's active
3. **Type exactly**: `help`
   - All lowercase is fine
4. **Press Enter**
5. **WATCH the screen** - text should appear immediately!
6. **You should see** a list of available commands appear, like this:

```
Available Commands:
  help      - Show this help message
  measure   - Take single measurement
  identify  - Query device identification
  auto      - Start auto mode (auto [seconds])
  stop      - Stop auto mode
  status    - Show system status
  sd-on     - Enable SD card logging
  sd-off    - Disable SD card logging
```

7. **After the commands**, you'll see the `VIA>` prompt again
8. **If you see this list**:
   - **PERFECT!** Everything is working!
   - You're ready to take measurements!
9. **If nothing happens or you see an error**:
   - See [Troubleshooting - No output](#problem-no-output-in-putty--console-is-blank)
   - Or see [Troubleshooting - Commands don't work](#problem-commands-dont-work--nothing-happens)

## Taking Measurements

Now the fun part - actually using the spectrometer to collect data!

### Single Measurement

Let's take ONE measurement.

1. **Make sure** you see the `VIA>` prompt in the PowerShell window
2. **Type exactly**: `measure`
3. **Press Enter**
4. **WATCH THE SCREEN** - lots of text will appear!
5. **BE PATIENT** - this takes about 15 seconds
6. **You'll see** progress messages like:
   - "Starting Measurement #1"
   - "Querying device identification..."
   - "Preparing measurement parameters..."
   - "Starting measurement..."
   - "Acquiring data..."
   - Lots of CSV data (numbers separated by commas)
   - "Measurement Complete!"
7. **After** all this text, you'll see the `VIA>` prompt again
8. **SUCCESS!** You just took your first measurement!
9. **Your data is automatically saved** in the AvaSpecDriver folder

### Automatic Mode (Take Measurements Repeatedly)

Want the spectrometer to take measurements automatically every minute? Here's how:

1. **At the `VIA>` prompt**, type: `auto 60`
   - That's the word "auto", a space, then the number "60"
   - The "60" means "every 60 seconds" (1 minute)
2. **Press Enter**
3. **You'll see**: `Auto-measurement mode STARTED`
4. **The system will now take a measurement every 60 seconds**
   - You'll see all the measurement text appear
   - Then it waits 60 seconds
   - Then takes another measurement
   - This repeats forever until you stop it
5. **To STOP automatic mode**:
   - **Type**: `stop`
   - **Press Enter**
   - You'll see: `Auto-measurement mode STOPPED`

**Want a different interval?**
- Type `auto 30` for every 30 seconds
- Type `auto 120` for every 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- Type `auto 300` for every 5 minutes (300 seconds)

### Check System Status

Want to see what's happening?

1. **Type**: `status`
2. **Press Enter**
3. **You'll see information like**:
   - SD Card Logging: ENABLED or DISABLED
   - Auto Mode: RUNNING or STOPPED
   - Auto Interval: How many seconds between measurements
   - Measurements Taken: Total count
   - Uptime: How long the system has been running
4. **This helps you check**:
   - Is automatic mode running?
   - How many measurements have been taken?
   - Is the SD card working?

### Turn SD Card Logging On/Off

If you have an SD card in the Teensy, you can control whether it saves data.

**To turn ON SD card logging:**
1. **Type**: `sd-on`
2. **Press Enter**
3. You'll see a confirmation message
4. Now all measurements will be saved to the SD card

**To turn OFF SD card logging:**
1. **Type**: `sd-off`
2. **Press Enter**
3. You'll see a confirmation message
4. Measurements will no longer be saved to the SD card (but still saved to your computer via VIA.bat)

## Data Capture

**Good News!** When you use `VIA.bat`, all measurements are **automatically saved** to timestamped session folders in the AvaSpecDriver directory. You don't need to do anything extra!

**Where to find your data:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `aeris-via-software\AvaSpecDriver\`
3. Look for folders with names like: `session_2025-11-13_14-30-25`
4. Inside you'll find all your CSV files

### Method 1: Automatic Logging (Using VIA.bat - RECOMMENDED)

**This happens automatically when you use VIA.bat:**
- Every measurement is saved to a CSV file
- Files are organized in timestamped session folders
- You can find them in the `AvaSpecDriver` folder
- Example: `session_2025-11-13_14-30-25\spectrum_0001.csv`

**To take measurements:**
1. Run `VIA.bat` (as described above)
2. Type `measure` to take a single measurement
3. Or type `auto 60` to take measurements every 60 seconds
4. Your data is automatically saved!

### Method 2: Manual Data Capture (Advanced)

If you want to manually capture data using Python scripts:

**Step 1: Open PowerShell in the AvaSpecDriver folder** (see previous section)

**Step 2: Capture a live measurement:**
```
python capture_measurement.py COM3 my_spectrum.csv
```
- Replace `COM3` with your actual COM port
- Replace `my_spectrum.csv` with your desired filename
- The script will wait for you to type `measure` in PuTTY/VIA console
- Data will be saved to `my_spectrum.csv`

**Step 3: List files on SD card:**
```
python file_transfer.py COM3 list
```

**Step 4: Download a specific file from SD card:**
```
python file_transfer.py COM3 get spectrum_0001.csv
```

### Method 3: Reading SD Card Directly

**Easiest way to get ALL your data:**
1. **Unplug** the Teensy from your computer
2. **Remove** the SD card from the Teensy
3. **Insert** the SD card into your computer (you may need an SD card reader)
4. **Open** the SD card in File Explorer
5. **Copy** all the files to your computer
6. Files will be named like:
   - `meas_0001.txt` (raw hex data)
   - `spectrum_0001.csv` (CSV format - use this one!)
7. **Safely eject** the SD card
8. **Re-insert** it into the Teensy
9. **Plug** the Teensy back into your computer
