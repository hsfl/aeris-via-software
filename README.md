4. Go to VSCode and initialize the PlatformIO extension.
5. In the "QUICK ACCESS" column, click on "Open" and then "Open Project" in the tab that opens. Locate and choose the "AvaSpecDriver" folder within the "aeris-via-software" folder.
* This should have opened the AvaSpecDriver folder as a PlatformIO project with all the dependencies and configurations it needs.
